### How to win
  - Each player has a battlefield represented by a 10x10 grid (default) on which he places 8 ships, hidden from his opponent.
  - The goal of the game is to sink all the opposing ships! A ship is sunk when it is hit once for each space it occupies.
  - In other words, a submarine, which occupies two spaces, is sunk after being hit twice.
  - The 8 ships occupy 25 total spaces, so the first player to record 25 hits wins!

### Place your ships

To place a ship you need to enter a departure coordinate (A1-J10 for the default 10x10 board) and a direction (vertical or horizontal).
- For example: "A1" and 'H' or "B7" and 'V'. 

Ships shall not overlap or be adjacent and shall remain within the boundaries of the edge.

- Shoot your opponentâ€™s ships by matching the coordinates.
- You will be informed if you have hit or missed a ship.
- Sink all 8 computer ships to win!
